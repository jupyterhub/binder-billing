# Explore the Binder billing data.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterhub/binder-billing/master?filepath=analyze_data.ipynb)

A quick visualization of our costs for running mybinder.org.

The data is pulled from the public Binder data repository here:

https://github.com/jupyterhub/binder-billing

If the data seems out-of-date, it's because that repository needs to be updated!
